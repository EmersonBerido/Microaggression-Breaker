# 🎮 Bias Breaker

**Bias Breaker** is an interactive microlearning game designed to help players recognize and respond to everyday bias. Through real-world scenarios and branching choices, players build empathy, challenge assumptions, and level up their allyship — one decision at a time.

> ⚠️ This project is currently in active development. Expect rapid iteration, occasional bugs, and lots of learning.
